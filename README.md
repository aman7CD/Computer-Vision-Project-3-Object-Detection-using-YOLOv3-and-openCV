# Object-Detection-using-YOLOv3-and-openCV
Used openCV library and YOLOv3 to detect objects in webcam live feed.

## Libraries used in the Project
### openCV
OpenCV is a Python library that allows you to perform image processing and computer vision tasks. It provides a wide range of features, including object detection, face recognition, and tracking.

### YOLO(you only look once)
YOLOv3 is a real-time object detection algorithm that identifies specific objects in videos, live feeds, or images. The YOLO machine learning algorithm uses features learned by a deep convolutional neural network to detect an object.
